# Perlin noise to SVG file
### Keryn was looking for a way to automate perlin noise glyph generation. This code is a combination of a few different js sketches, it uses a previous build (version) of p5js + [p5.svg.js by Zeno Zeng](https://github.com/zenozeng/p5.js-svg) and the [Perlin noise p5js code from Gene Kogan](https://genekogan.com/code/p5js-perlin-noise/)
### *Thanks also to Finn Arundel who patiently sleuthed the p5-svg.js solution :)*
