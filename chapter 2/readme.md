# Working with Fonts

## Good to know:
* Drag your font across to your editor window from your finder, to have the font appear in your data/ folder
* Declare a variable for your font.
* Load your font with `preload() {}` function, assign it to your variable
* Set the sketch font as your variable with `textFont()`
* set your background to refresh in the `draw()` function if possible so that your text stays sharp

* write your text to the page with `text('your text', x, y)`
